<title>SQL Message Store</title>
<para>
    The Java broker has a message store implementation backed by JDBC API.
    This section will detail configuration for using the JDBCMessageStore.
  </para>

  <para>
    The JDBCMessageStore can be selected on Virtual Host creation
    via <link linkend="Java-Broker-Configuring-And-Managing-REST-API">REST Management interfaces</link>
    and <link linkend="Java-Broker-Configuring-And-Managing-Web-Console">Web Management Console</link>.
    For details, see <xref linkend="Java-Broker-Virtual-Hosts"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
    Alternatively, the JDBCMessageStore can configured in Virtual Host configuration xml.
    For details, see <xref linkend="Java-Broker-Stores-JDBC-Store-Configuration"/>.
  </para>

  <section role="h3" id="Java-Broker-Stores-JDBC-Store-Driver">
    <title>JDBC driver</title>
    <para>
      Only JDBC 4.0 compatible drivers can be used with JDBCMessageStore as it does not register a driver class explicitly.
      In order to use a JDBCMessageStore a driver library is required to be present in the Broker classpath.
      For the standard Broker distribution a driver library can be put into ${QPID_HOME}/lib/opt folder.
