<chapter id="Java-Broker-Virtual-Hosts">
  <title>Virtual Hosts</title>

  <section id="Java-Broker-Virtual-Hosts-Configuring-Managing">
      <title>Configuring And Managing</title>
      <para>One or more Virtual Hosts can be configured on the Broker. The
      <link linkend="Java-Broker-Configuring-And-Managing-REST-API">REST Management interfaces</link>
      and <link linkend="Java-Broker-Configuring-And-Managing-Web-Console">Web Management Console</link>
      can be used to add and delete Virtual Hosts.</para>

      <para>A new Virtual Host can be created in two ways by specifying either:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>A <link linkend="Java-Broker-Stores">store type</link> and a store path</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>A path to Virtual Host XML configuration file</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        In first case the virtual host attributes are derived from Broker global attributes.
        In the second case, the Virtual Host specific configuration can be set in the configuration XML,
        for example, alert thresholds, message store, queues, exchanges, ACL etc. The first way of Virtual Host creation
        is more preferable as it will reduce the burden of configuration changes when migrating to a newer version,
        especially, when the support of Virtual Host configuration XML will be removed. However, the second way
        is the only way at the moment to configure <link linkend="Java-Broker-Stores-HA-BDB-Store">HA Message Store</link>,
        Virtual Host <link linkend="Java-Broker-Security-ACLs">ACL</link> and virtual host specific attributes.
      </para>

      <para>The following Virtual Host Managing operations are available from
        <link linkend="Java-Broker-Configuring-And-Managing-Web-Console">Web Management Console</link>:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem><para>A new Virtual Host can be added into Broker by pressing "Add Virtual Host" button
            on the Broker tab.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>The existing Virtual Host(s) can be removed by pressing "Remove Virtual Host" button on the Broker tab.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>The Virtual Host details can be viewed on the Virtual Host tab.
            This tab can be displayed after clicking onto Virtual Host Name in the Broker object tree
            or onto the Virtual Host row in the Virtual Hosts grid on the Broker tab.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>Queues can be configured (added/removed) from Virtual Host tab</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>Exchange can be configured (added/removed) from Virtual Host tab</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>Existing Exchange/Queue tabs can be navigated from Virtual Host tab</para></listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </para>
