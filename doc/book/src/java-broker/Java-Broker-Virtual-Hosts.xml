      <para>
        One or more Virtual Hosts can be configured on the Broker. The
        <link linkend="Java-Broker-Configuring-And-Managing-HTTP-Management-Introduction">HTTP management interfaces</link>
        can be used to add and delete Virtual Hosts.
      </para>

      <para>A new Virtual Host can be created in two ways:
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    <emphasis>Supplying simply a <link linkend="Java-Broker-Stores">store type</link> and a store path</emphasis>: In this case,
                    the virtual host attributes are currently derived from default attribute values defined on the broker. This is the preferred approach.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    <emphasis>Supplying the path to a <link linkend="Java-Broker-Virtual-Hosts-Configuration-File">Virtual Host XML configuration file</link></emphasis>: In this case, specific per-virtualhost attribute configuration
                    can be set in the file, as well as pre-configuring queues, exchanges, etc. This is no longer the preferred approach and will likely be removed in
                    a future release, however it is currently still neccessary to support certain use-cases such as per-virtualhost attribute configuration, and
                    specialised store configuration such as for the <link linkend="Java-Broker-Stores-HA-BDB-Store">BDB HA Message Store</link>.
