  <title>Memory Store</title>
  <para>
    The Java broker has an in-memory message store implementation.
    This section will detail configuration for using the MemoryMessageStore.
  </para>
  <para>
    Note: when using this store, the broker will store both persistent and non-persistent messages
    in memory, which is to say that neither will be available following a broker restart, and the
    ability to store new messages will be entirely constrained by the JVM heap size.
  </para>

  <section role="h3" id="Java-Broker-Stores-Memory-Store-Configuration">
    <title>Configuration</title>
    <para>
      In order to use the MemoryMessageStore, you must configure it for each VirtualHost desired by updating the store element
      to specify the associated store class, as shown below.
    </para>
