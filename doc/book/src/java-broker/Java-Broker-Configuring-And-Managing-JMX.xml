<section id="Java-Broker-Configuring-And-Managing-JMX">
    <title>JMX Plugin</title>

    <para>JMX Management Plugin exposes JMX management interfaces to manage the Broker.
    It is included into initial configuration by default and starts the RMI registry and JMX connector on pre-configured RMI and JMX ports.
    If any or both JMX Ports are missed but JMX Management Plugin entry is present in the Broker configuration the Broker fails to start.
    Only one JMX Management Plugin can be configured on the Broker.
    </para>

    <para>JMX Management Plugin can start its own MBean server or can use a platform MBean server.
    By default, the platform MBean server is used. This is controlled by the value of the plugin attribute "Use Platform MBean Server".
    The value of this attribute can be changed through REST management interface but takes effect only on next Broker restart.</para>
