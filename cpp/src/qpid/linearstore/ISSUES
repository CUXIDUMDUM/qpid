Current/pending:
================
 Q-JIRA RHBZ     Description / Comments
 ------ -------  ----------------------
   5359 -        Linearstore: Implement new management schema and wire into store
   5360 -        Linearstore: Evaluate and rework logging to produce a consistent log outputConsistent logging
   5361 -        Linearstore: No tests for linearstore functionality currently exist
                   * No existing tests for linearstore:
                   ** Basic broker-level tests for txn and non-txn recovery
                   ** Store-level tests which check write boundary conditions
                   ** EFP tests, including file recovery, error management
                   ** Unit tests
                   ** Basic performance tests
   5362 -        Linearstore: No store tools exist for examining the journals
                   svn r.1558888 2014-01-09: WIP checkin for linearstore version of qpid_qls_analyze. Needs testing and tidy-up.
                   * Store analysis and status

   -    1036026  [LinearStore] Qpid linear store unable to create durable queue - framing-error: Queue <q-name>: create() failed: jexception 0x0000
                   UNABLE TO REPRODUCE - but Frantizek has additional info
   -    1039522  Qpid crashes while recovering from linear store around apid::linearstore::journal::JournalFile::getFqFileName() including enq_rec::decode() threw JERR_JREC_BAD_RECTAIL
                   * Possible dup of 1039525
                   * May be fixed by QPID-5483 - waiting for needinfo
   -    1039525  Qpid crashes while recovering from linear store around apid::linearstore::journal::jexception::format including enq_rec::decode() threw JERR_JREC_BAD_REC_TAIL

                   * May be linked to RHBZ 1039525 - waiting for needinfo

Future:
=======
* One journal file lost when queue deleted. All files except for one are recycled back to the EFP.
* Complete exceptions - several exceptions thrown using jexception have no exception numbers
* Investigate ability of store to detect missing journal files, especially from logical end of a journal
* Investigate ability of store to handle file muddle-ups (ie journal files from EFP which are not zeroed or other journals)
* Look at improving the efficiency of recovery - right now the entire store is read once, and then each recovered record xid and data is read again

Code tidy-up
------------
* Remove old comments
* Use c++ cast templates instead of (xxx)y
* Member names: xxx_
* Rename classes, functions and variables to camel-case
* Add Doxygen docs to classes
