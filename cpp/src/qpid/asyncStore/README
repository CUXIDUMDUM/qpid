This folder contains source code for the new async store module. It implements the interface
described in qpid/broker/AsyncStore.h.

NOTE: This is NOT the current (old) async store module implemented through the sync interface
in qpid/broker/MessageStoere.h. That store will continue to be kept separately at
https://svn.jboss.org/repos/rhmessaging/store/trunk/cpp (or if no checkin credentials, then
read-only at http://anonsvn.jboss.org/repos/rhmessaging/store/trunk/cpp).

Layout
------

qpid
  |
  +---asyncStore (Interface layer with broker)
        | 
        +---jrnl2 (Async journal)


The jrnl2 directory contains the asynchronous journal code, and contains all the journal
file management and low-level writing and reading. This code knows only about writing
opaque data blobs to disk in records which may or may not contain a transaction identifier.
Records may be enqueued (written) or dequeued (which writes to disk the logical deletion of an
earlier enqueued record).

The upper asyncStore directory contains the implementation of the broker's AsyncStore
interface and the necessary logic to interface this to the jrnl2 code. It also provides
transaction handling and recovery logic.

Building
--------
Currently, this module is a Linux-only module, owing to the dependency of the jrnl2 layer
on the Linux-only libaio library.

Only cmake is supported.
