The org.apache.qpid.restapi.HttpTransaction and org.apache.qpid.restapi.Server interfaces are intended to
provide abstractions to the underlying HTTP Server technology and thus should make it fairly easy to do
a Servlet based implementation without having to rewrite the core REST API code. A Servlet implementation
is still on the "TODO" list though.
