Qpid Dispatch TODO List
==============================================================================
Beyond this simple laundry list, you can find the list of bugs and
enhancements to be fixed by going to the Apache Qpid JIRA instance:

    http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID
==============================================================================

- Router Mode:
  o Stand-Alone-Router - Does not participate in routing protocol, does not permit inter-router
                         links, acts as a normal interior-router otherwise.
  o Interior-Router - Participates in the routing protocol
  o Edge-Concentrator - Does not participate in routing protocol, requires uplink connection(s)
                        This mode should be used when Dispatch is integrated into an endpoint
                        application or when it is acting as a connection concentrator.
                        Proxy and access-protocol functions will be available in this mode.

- Connection Annotation:
  o Type: Inter-router, uplink, endpoint, etc.  This formal annotation can be accessed internally
    by the connection handlers to guide Dispatch's handling of new connections.
  o Weight-{in,out}: Weight/Cost metrics for inter-router links

- Statistics for Instrumentation:
  o Link
    . delivery count {unsettled, pre-settled}
    . deliveries {accepted, rejected, released, modified}
    . octets of delivery {accepted, rejected, released, modified}
    . flow frame count
    . disposition frame count {forward, backward}
  o Address
    . deliveries {ingress, egress, transit}
    . octets of delivery {ingress, egress, transit}

- Infrastructure
  o Router_Link - Buffer and Iterator for a copy of the link's target address (for use
                  as an address for messages with no 'to' field).
  o Router Event Queue - Event queue to feed alerts to the Python router code.
                         Neighbor-link-loss is a valuable event because it accelerates the
                         detection of topology change.
  o All PyRouter stimulus through a work queue.
  o Router Code Updates
    . Report address mappings to routers
    . Generate RA immediately after updating routing tables
    . Generate unsolicited updates for mobile addresses?
  o Expose idle-timeout/keepalive on connectors and listeners

- Major Roadmap Features
  o Security Policy Enforcement
  o Proxy (Translation Node) Capability
  o Address Provisioning with variable semantics
  o Link Routing
  o Management, Instrumentation, and Accounting
  o Link Cost
  o Area Routing
