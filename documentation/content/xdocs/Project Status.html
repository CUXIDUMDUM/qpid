<h3><a name="ProjectStatus-Status"></a>Status</h3>

<p>Qpid is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF</p>

<h3><a name="ProjectStatus-Graduation"></a>Graduation</h3>

<p>We are actively working toward graduation. In our last graduation vote we had thought that we needed a diverse committer base (which we have), however we came to learn that the PMC also needs good diversity (yes - thinking about this it is logical). So we stopped our graduation vote in order to add representation on our PPMC.</p>

<p>If you would like to become a committer and join the PPMC, <a href="Getting Involved.html" title="Getting Involved">this is how we do it</a>. We would love to have you on the project!</p>
