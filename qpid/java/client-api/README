1. Running the C++ binding
============================
1. Build the c++ source using cmake.
   (I haven't added automake support yet, don't plan to do so.)

2. Set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH path as follows.
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${cmake-build-dir}/src/:${cmake-build-dir}/bindings/qpid/java/

3. Set the classpath for the java client and run the example as follows.
   java -cp $QP org.apache.qpid.messaging.cpp.CppTest

4. If it complains that libmawt.so cannot be found, then add it as follows to the  LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   Ex export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${path-to-java}/jre/lib/amd64/xawt/
   (You need to search for libmawt.so in your Java installation for the correct path and add it.)
