<section id="Java-Broker-Stores-Memory-Store">
  <title>Memory Message Store</title>
  <para>
    The Java broker has an in-memory message store implementation.
    This section will detail configuration for using the MemoryMessageStore.
  </para>
  <para>
    Note: when using this store, the broker will store both persistent and non-persistent messages
    in memory, which is to say that neither will be available following a broker restart, and the
    ability to store new messages will be entirely constrained by the JVM heap size.
  </para>

  <para>
    The MemoryMessageStore can be selected on Virtual Host creation
    via <link linkend="Java-Broker-Configuring-And-Managing-REST-API">REST Management interfaces</link>
    and <link linkend="Java-Broker-Configuring-And-Managing-Web-Console">Web Management Console</link>.
    For details, see <xref linkend="Java-Broker-Virtual-Hosts"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
    Alternatively, the MemoryMessageStore can configured in Virtual Host configuration xml.
    For details, see <xref linkend="Java-Broker-Stores-Memory-Store-Configuration"/>.
  </para>
