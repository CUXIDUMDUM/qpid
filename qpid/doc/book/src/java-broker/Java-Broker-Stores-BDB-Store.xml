    <title>Oracle BDB JE download</title>
    <para>
      The BDB based message store is optional due to its dependency on Oracle BDB JE, which is distributed under the Sleepycat
      licence. As a result of this, the dependency cant be distributed by the Apache Qpid project as part of the broker release package.
    </para>
    <para>
       If you wish to use the BDBMessageStore, then you must download the Oracle BDB JE &oracleBdbProductVersion; release
      <ulink url="&oracleJeDownloadUrl;">from the Oracle website.</ulink>
    </para>
    <para>
      The download has a name in the form je-&oracleBdbProductVersion;.tar.gz. It is recommended that you
      confirm the integrity of the download by verifying the MD5.
