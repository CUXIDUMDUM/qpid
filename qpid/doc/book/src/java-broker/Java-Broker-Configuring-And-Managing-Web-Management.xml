<section id="Java-Broker-Configuring-And-Managing-Web-Management">
    <title>Web Management</title>

    <para>Web Management Plugin exposes REST management interfaces and provides the Web Management Console to configure the Broker.
    It is included into initial configuration by default and starts the servlet container on pre-configured HTTP ports.
    If no HTTP Port is configured but Web Management Plugin entry is present in the Broker configuration the Broker fails to start.
    Only one Web Management Plugin can be configured on the Broker.
    </para>

    <para>Web Management itself can be configured through REST management interfaces and Web Management Console.
    The following attributes can be set on Web Management Plugin:
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para><emphasis>Basic Authentication for HTTP</emphasis> is flag to enable/disable
        Basic Authentication on HTTP ports. It is set to false by default.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><emphasis>Basic Authentication for HTTPS</emphasis> is flag to enable/disable
        Basic Authentication on HTTPS ports. It is set to true by default.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><emphasis>SASL Authentication for HTTP</emphasis> is flag to enable/disable
        SASL Authentication on HTTP ports. It is set to true by default.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><emphasis>SASL Authentication for HTTPS</emphasis> is flag to enable/disable
        SASL Authentication on HTTPS ports. It is set to true by default.</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para><emphasis>Session timeout</emphasis> is the timeout in seconds to close the HTTP session.
        It is set to 10 minutes by default.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    On clicking on Web Management Plugin name in Broker object tree the tab for Web Management Plugin is displayed with current plugin settings.
    The plugin attributes can be changed by clicking on "Edit" button in Plugin tab. The changes will take effect only after Broker is restarted.
