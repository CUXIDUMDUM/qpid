<title>Ports</title>
<para><emphasis>Port</emphasis> is a named broker entity serving as a communications end-point
and providing the AMQP transport layer over the given TCP port. The particular AMQP protocols can be configured on the Port.
As result, different <emphasis>Ports</emphasis> can support different protocols. Any number of <emphasis>Ports</emphasis>
can be configured on the Broker.</para>
<para>
    The following AMQP protocols are currently supported by the Broker:
